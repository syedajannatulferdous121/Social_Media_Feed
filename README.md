# Social_Media_Feed
This is a basic frontend implementation of a social media feed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It includes a header with navigation, a main section with a post form and list, and a footer. Users can view and create posts, and the posts are displayed dynamically. The code provides a foundation for building a social media feed frontend.
